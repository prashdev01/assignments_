    "- The PMF assigns a probability to each value of the random variable, allowing us to calculate the exact probability of observing a specific value.\n",
    "- The PMF is typically represented by a function that maps each possible value of the random variable to its corresponding probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this die assigns a probability of 1/6 to each possible outcome (values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) and assigns a probability of 0 to any other value outside this range. The PMF can be represented as:\n",
