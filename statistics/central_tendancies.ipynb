    "2. median : median is the middle value in the ordered dataset , to find the median the data point are arrangend in ascending or descending order, and the value in the middle possition is selected , if there is an even number of values rather than there magnitude , it provides a measure of central value that diveds the data into two equal halves.\n",
    "3. mode : the mode is the values that appears most frequentaly in the dataset. in other words is is the value with the highset frequency . A dataset can have no mode (if no value is repeated) , one mode (if the there is a value with the highest frequncy ), or multiple modes ( if multiple values shared the highest frequency .) the mode is use for identifying the most common or frequently  occuring values(s) in a dataset.
