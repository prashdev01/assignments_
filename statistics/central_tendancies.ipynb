A dataset can have no mode (if no value is repeated) , one mode (if the there is a value with the highest frequncy ), or multiple modes ( if multiple values shared the highest frequency .) the mode is use for identifying the most common or frequently  occuring values(s) in a dataset.

Range : the range is simplest measure of desperasion and is calculated as the diffrence between the maximum and the minimum values in the dataset, it provides the measuse of the total spread of the data , however it only considers two data point doesnt take into account the distribution of the remainig values .\n",
    "### Example: Consider the following dataset representing the daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) of a city for a week: [15, 17, 14, 19, 12, 16, 18]. The range can be calculated as follows: Range = Maximum value - Minimum value = 19 - 12 = 7 degrees Celsius. \n",
